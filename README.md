### Socioeconomic and Race Bias in the Bridge2AI Voice Dataset
## Introduction:
This research project was conducted as part of the Bridge2AI Voice Summer School program. The project aimed to explore the presence of socioeconomic and race bias in the Bridge2AI (B2AI) Voice dataset, which is used to develop AI models for healthcare applications.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare by advancing diagnostics, treatment, and patient monitoring (Bensoussan et al., 2024). Using large datasets and sophisticated algorithms, AI achieves high accuracy in health data analysis, yet faces significant challenges with bias (Sara et al., 2023).

Bias in AI can exacerbate healthcare disparities, arising from flawed algorithms and imbalanced training data (Markl, 2022). This issue is critical in voice biomarkers, which analyze vocal characteristics to monitor health conditions (Sara et al., 2023). Ensuring fairness and effectiveness in these systems requires high-quality, representative data, particularly regarding socioeconomic status (Fagherazzi et al., 2021).

## SES Results:
Data Augmentation: Data augmentation is a useful technique for working with skewed datasets with small sample sizes, as it increases the performance of the model.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are able to distinguish between different SES classes based on spectrogram analysis.
Bias Detection: We identified disparities in accurate predictions for each diagnosis, indicating strong bias related to patients' socioeconomic status in the dataset.
